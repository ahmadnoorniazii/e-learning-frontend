{
  data: {
    id: number,
    attributes: {
      firstName: string,
      user: {
        data: {
          id: number,
          attributes: { username, email }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Transformed Interface
{
  id: number,
  firstName: string,
  user: {
    id: number,
    username: string,
    email: string
  }
}
```
